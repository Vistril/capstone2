      <h3 style="margin-right:500px;"> You know that good ol' MIDI mess that immediately fills your ears called MultiplayerPiano. Everyone in BitKit Interactive comes from it. Now, it exists in VR. TBA 2021. Best played on Oculus, WMR headset or equivalent.</h3>

        <h2 style="color:#000;font-size:70px;">AN EGGY MESS</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-right:550px;color:#000"> Remember playing that old game as a kid where you bounced a poor sucker around on the trampoline called "Crack The Egg"? Well, it's not entirely the same thing, but Eggy Mess does come with 100% egg-related-violence. Use slingshots and super-advanced scrambled warfare to come out on top as the superior chicken byproduct. Best played on Valve Index or equivalent with full-body and external tracking.</h3>

        <h3 style="margin-right:550px;color:#000"> Out of Grasp is a comfortable, pleasantly disorienting game that challenges your spacial awareness by very generously confusing the hell out of you with optical illusions. Could you make it through an evil factory that's trying to kill you with no real knowledge of what's real? Best played on Valve Index, or equivalent with external tracking. </h3>
