                    <p style='margin-left:110px;width:650px;word-wrap:break-word;'>"In Act 1 on of the most important parts is when the group of girls start accusing people of witchcraft. One of the reasons for this is that there is no way for for someone to get out of this, you either admit to it and die or you don’t and you still die. At the end they accuse more people and it counted up to 12 people. When the town ain’t that big to start with and they accuse 12 people this isn’t going end well. In conclusion because it could change the whole town the moment when they accuse 12 people of being with the devil it is the most important part in act 1.

                    <h3>Makers</h3>
                    <p style='margin-left:110px;width:650px;word-wrap:break-word;'>Cory Doctorow, the author of Makers, specializes in writing books that are Science Fiction and is a journalist and activist alongside that. Some of his best titles are Little Brother, Walkaway and Pirate Cinema. His website is at craphound.com and is also a blogger at boingboing.net. He is also visiting professors at the University of South Carolina's School of Library and Information Science, also a notable activist and founder of the UK Open Rights group. You'll find in a lot of the books he writes the characters do actively exercise and support their rights to win. 
                            Abandoned Walmarts, discarded Elmo toys, and running from AK-47’s is what makes Makers a very interesting read. Perry and Lester are two garage inventors, who make things with probably the weirdest medium; old Elmo toys that never got off the shelves. Things such as toasters or even a car. The business of manufacturing with Elmo toys is booming, until one day, it all collapses. The New Work, the story setting’s business capital, just stopped. Lester and Perry build amusement rides in abandoned Walmarts to commemorate the late New Work, and then end up in a legal mess with a Disney executive. 
                            This book was, quite frankly, a wild ride. It seemed more like a Ray Bradbury book than it did a Cory Doctorow book, which quite heavily emphasises civil rights, where as this one is some crazy scenario which has two goofy guys as the main characters. Now, this isn’t bad at all, just not something I expected from Doctorow. Typically, they have an intense dystopian society theme to it. This book does have that, but it’s nothing really actually engaging. Overall though, a pretty good book.

                            “Having this writing system, you can teach kids how to speak Fulani just like you teach them to speak English. It will help preserve the language and let people be creative and innovative.” Microsoft Story Labs have provided an African society with a new writing system that helps combat illiteracy. It’s called ADLaM, and the system has only just began it’s addition to Unicode, and it has a movement through social media.
                                ADLaM and the alphabet were created by two brothers named Ibrahima and Abdoulaye Barry, from Guinea, and wanted to create an alphabet for their native language called Fulfulde. The process went like this: They shut themselves in a room and mindlessly drew shapes on a paper with their eyes shut. Then, they’d individually go through each shape and decide which one they liked best for all the sounds. This is what became known as the ADLaM system. Eventually, they bring coverage to Microsoft, and MS makes it happen. “We just wanted people to be able to write correctly in their own language, but we didn’t know what that meant. We didn’t know how much work it would be. If we knew everything we would have to go through, I don’t think we would have done it.” Illiteracy was a notable issue in the community, so this was a big improvement. The Fulbhe were nomadists who generally settled in West Africa, more specifically in Sudan to Senegal. “ADLaM is an acronym that translates to ‘the alphabet that will prevent a people from being lost’”
                                This is moving. Two brothers pushed for a missing piece in their society that was much needed. With the help of Microsoft and modern technology, they were able to make it a reality. It’s quite interesting, the process of encoding fonts. Individual letters are not represented by pictures, but by pure raw data themselves. I’m studying Computer Science and fonts are something I just can’t grasp yet. A TrueType font file is what stores it, but I don’t know what other component of the operating system parses it. I’d like to be able to do something like this one day, but on a smaller scale, since there’s not really a need for me to make a whole new font face.

                    <p style='margin-left:110px;width:650px;word-wrap:break-word;'>The Perils of Indifference by Elie Weisel was unknowingly one of the best speeches given. Bill and Hillary Clinton invited many intelligible speakers for an event at the White House for the turn of the millenium. Elie Weisel’s speech was to motivate people to do something when they see other people suffering. Wiesel already was a victim of the Holocaust. He talks about indifference with his own situation and what results from it. Wiesel was not afraid to criticize the United States, and, the other things happening in this period of time. 
                            The speech perfectly conveys his point of view of tragedies within the Nazi period within the Holocaust and other problems caused by indifference.

<h3>The Illustrated Man</h3>

	<strong>The Long Rain</strong><br>    
                    In Ray Bradbury’s short story “The Long Rain” in The Illustrated Man, a lieutenant and his crew on Venus don’t quite make it to their destination, the Sundome. The Lieutenant is most likely to blame for this; The Lieutenant was a lone survivor to the Sundome, his loneliness drove him to complete insanity, and did not do a sufficient job of protecting his crew from things that killed them. The Lieutenant had promised they’d make it, even though their death was almost guaranteed and he knew this. The sundomes weren’t even functional anymore, due to the government cutting off funding. False hope is one of the worst things you could give to a person, especially when it involves a truly life-threatening situation that is almost certain to have a bad outcome. When they, or, the Lieutenant rather, made it to the sundome, he was alone. He did make it with one other crew member, but the crew member took his own life. He did that due to mental deterioration caused by the rain, which never stopped. The Lieutenant made a poor effort to help them cope with all the trials they faced on the journey. He wanted the benefits all for himself.

                            Cory Doctorow, the author of Walkaway, specializes in writing books that are Science Fiction and is a journalist and activist alongside that. Some of his best titles are Little Brother, Walkaway and Pirate Cinema. His website is at craphound.com and is also a blogger at boingboing.net. He is also visiting professors at the University of South Carolina's School of Library and Information Science, also a notable activist and founder of the UK Open Rights group. You'll find in a lot of the books he writes the characters do actively exercise and support their rights to win. Canada, in the future, is not promising. The economy is a mess. The government is in ruins, many refugees perish, on top of ecological issues as well. It's all real in Walkaway.  Hubert, Etc. (he has over 19 middle names) and his buddy Seth (hey, that's me!), both 19, are two somewhat poor average-joes and survivors of this ruined world. They go to a "Communist Party," hosted by their friend Natalie, who is a daughter of a super-rich family that specializes in 3D modeling and engineering. Everything is all fun and games until the police roll-up. The three ditch the place and decided they were sick of "The Man," who runs Canada and his rules. So they leave and run off to a place very far away. Like many books, movies, and other various media that feature a dystopian society with a rebellion, Walkaway is also very moving to me. It made striking resemblances to the game Half-Life 2, a first-person shooter published by Valve that also has a setting of a dystopian society. Black Mesa Research caused a "Resonance Cascade," which makes an interdimensional rip forcing Aliens from the Borderworld, "Xen," to leak out on to Earth. This event catches the eye of the Combine, to take over Earth within only seven hours, thus causing the Seven Hour War. The Combine is similar to The Empire from Star Wars, but a whole lot more inhumane. Walkaway still has some differences, though, as an external world force doesn't run this dystopian society, more or less. The book has lots of edge-of-your-seat and gripping action. "Cory Doctorow has authored the Bhagavad Gita of hacker/maker/burner/open source/git/gnu/wiki/99%/adjunct faculty/Anonymous/shareware/Thingiverse/cypherpunk/LGTBQIA*/squatter/upcycling culture and zipped it down into a pretty damned tight techno-thriller with a lot of sex in it", says Neal Stephenson, writer of System of the World and many other techno-thriller cypherpunk books.

                        As sick and twisted the Salem witch trials were, it's still a prevalent topic to learn and expand on. In It's Been 327 years Since the Salem Witch Trials, but Fear is Ruling America Again, by Noel Johnson, we go over how America today has many similarities to the witch trials. Three hundred twenty-seven years ago, in the early civilizations of America, some "witchcraft" occurred, and people began pointing fingers. The accused were called a Witch and publicly hanged, burned, or crushed. It didn't matter who you were. Women, men, and children alike. The witch trials were initially supposed to be delegated, legal proceedings, but the anger got the best of the society, and they were lynching mobs. The Witch Trials were a long time ago, though, and nothing like it has happened since,  right up until this day and age, where terrorism and the deportation of illegal immigrants is a popular topic right now. Many have said they've never seen our country so divided before. The new administration has caused much chaos, and our society is off balance. Similar to how we searched for and removed the so-called Witches, we also make adjustments to our arguments or the law to be able to remove the modern-day witches. Are we fixing this unbalance? Are we trying hard enough? Probably not. While it is pretty set in stone, we're not going to go back to public lynchings, but the world has gotten to the point where we cannot forget the aftermath of the witch trials.

                        Large corporations suffer from failure all the time. All over in the news, you see
                    scandalous operations from these companies. While it may seem all they get from it
                    is consequences, there’s still a high amount of benefit from them, as well. Do you know how
                    everyone has told you that you learn from your failures? That applies to just about everyone and
                    everything else as well. When companies mess up, they learn from their failures and ultimately
                    succeed afterward — the CEO of Coca Cola Co. James Quincy pushed for his employees to
                    overcome the fear of failure because he knew that failure wasn’t that much of a big deal. “If
                    we’re not making mistakes, we’re not trying hard enough.” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings worried
                    that his service was offering too many new hit shows and canceling too many original and loved ones.
                    “We have to take more risk, to try more crazy things, we should have a higher cancel rate
                    overall.” Not all companies learn from failure, though. Everyone knows what happened with
                    Mark Zuckerberg, possibly the most influential and well-known scandal so far. Zuckerberg was
                    found selling Facebook users’ data to third-party and malicious sources. Huawei’s
                    telecommunications department was being used as a gateway to send data of American citizens
                    to the Chinese government. Google, the provider of the mobile operating system, cut off
                    Huawei’s usage of their services, and Huawei was boycotted from trade in the U.S.
                    You only learn from failure if you care to, and try.
