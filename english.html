                    <strong>The Long Rain</strong><br>    
                    In Ray Bradbury’s short story “The Long Rain” in The Illustrated Man, a lieutenant and his crew on Venus don’t quite make it to their destination, the Sundome. The Lieutenant is most likely to blame for this; The Lieutenant was a lone survivor to the Sundome, his loneliness drove him to complete insanity, and did not do a sufficient job of protecting his crew from things that killed them. The Lieutenant had promised they’d make it, even though their death was almost guaranteed and he knew this. The sundomes weren’t even functional anymore, due to the government cutting off funding. False hope is one of the worst things you could give to a person, especially when it involves a truly life-threatening situation that is almost certain to have a bad outcome. When they, or, the Lieutenant rather, made it to the sundome, he was alone. He did make it with one other crew member, but the crew member took his own life. He did that due to mental deterioration caused by the rain, which never stopped. The Lieutenant made a poor effort to help them cope with all the trials they faced on the journey. He wanted the benefits all for himself.

                            Cory Doctorow, the author of Walkaway, specializes in writing books that are Science Fiction and is a journalist and activist alongside that. Some of his best titles are Little Brother, Walkaway and Pirate Cinema. His website is at craphound.com and is also a blogger at boingboing.net. He is also visiting professors at the University of South Carolina's School of Library and Information Science, also a notable activist and founder of the UK Open Rights group. You'll find in a lot of the books he writes the characters do actively exercise and support their rights to win. Canada, in the future, is not promising. The economy is a mess. The government is in ruins, many refugees perish, on top of ecological issues as well. It's all real in Walkaway.  Hubert, Etc. (he has over 19 middle names) and his buddy Seth (hey, that's me!), both 19, are two somewhat poor average-joes and survivors of this ruined world. They go to a "Communist Party," hosted by their friend Natalie, who is a daughter of a super-rich family that specializes in 3D modeling and engineering. Everything is all fun and games until the police roll-up. The three ditch the place and decided they were sick of "The Man," who runs Canada and his rules. So they leave and run off to a place very far away. Like many books, movies, and other various media that feature a dystopian society with a rebellion, Walkaway is also very moving to me. It made striking resemblances to the game Half-Life 2, a first-person shooter published by Valve that also has a setting of a dystopian society. Black Mesa Research caused a "Resonance Cascade," which makes an interdimensional rip forcing Aliens from the Borderworld, "Xen," to leak out on to Earth. This event catches the eye of the Combine, to take over Earth within only seven hours, thus causing the Seven Hour War. The Combine is similar to The Empire from Star Wars, but a whole lot more inhumane. Walkaway still has some differences, though, as an external world force doesn't run this dystopian society, more or less. The book has lots of edge-of-your-seat and gripping action. "Cory Doctorow has authored the Bhagavad Gita of hacker/maker/burner/open source/git/gnu/wiki/99%/adjunct faculty/Anonymous/shareware/Thingiverse/cypherpunk/LGTBQIA*/squatter/upcycling culture and zipped it down into a pretty damned tight techno-thriller with a lot of sex in it", says Neal Stephenson, writer of System of the World and many other techno-thriller cypherpunk books.

                        We all procrastinate. It's part of our nature. Or, sometimes, we obsess over something so much, 
                        we never get it done. Just like the website you're probably reading this on right now. It's never going to be perfect, so Just Get It Done perfectly embodies the normal spirit of a typical highschool student.

                        As sick and twisted the Salem witch trials were, it's still a prevalent topic to learn and expand on. In It's Been 327 years Since the Salem Witch Trials, but Fear is Ruling America Again, by Noel Johnson, we go over how America today has many similarities to the witch trials. Three hundred twenty-seven years ago, in the early civilizations of America, some "witchcraft" occurred, and people began pointing fingers. The accused were called a Witch and publicly hanged, burned, or crushed. It didn't matter who you were. Women, men, and children alike. The witch trials were initially supposed to be delegated, legal proceedings, but the anger got the best of the society, and they were lynching mobs. The Witch Trials were a long time ago, though, and nothing like it has happened since,  right up until this day and age, where terrorism and the deportation of illegal immigrants is a popular topic right now. Many have said they've never seen our country so divided before. The new administration has caused much chaos, and our society is off balance. Similar to how we searched for and removed the so-called Witches, we also make adjustments to our arguments or the law to be able to remove the modern-day witches. Are we fixing this unbalance? Are we trying hard enough? Probably not. While it is pretty set in stone, we're not going to go back to public lynchings, but the world has gotten to the point where we cannot forget the aftermath of the witch trials.

                        Large corporations suffer from failure all the time. All over in the news, you see
                    scandalous operations from these companies. While it may seem all they get from it
                    is consequences, there’s still a high amount of benefit from them, as well. Do you know how
                    everyone has told you that you learn from your failures? That applies to just about everyone and
                    everything else as well. When companies mess up, they learn from their failures and ultimately
                    succeed afterward — the CEO of Coca Cola Co. James Quincy pushed for his employees to
                    overcome the fear of failure because he knew that failure wasn’t that much of a big deal. “If
                    we’re not making mistakes, we’re not trying hard enough.” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings worried
                    that his service was offering too many new hit shows and canceling too many original and loved ones.
                    “We have to take more risk, to try more crazy things, we should have a higher cancel rate
                    overall.” Not all companies learn from failure, though. Everyone knows what happened with
                    Mark Zuckerberg, possibly the most influential and well-known scandal so far. Zuckerberg was
                    found selling Facebook users’ data to third-party and malicious sources. Huawei’s
                    telecommunications department was being used as a gateway to send data of American citizens
                    to the Chinese government. Google, the provider of the mobile operating system, cut off
                    Huawei’s usage of their services, and Huawei was boycotted from trade in the U.S.
                    You only learn from failure if you care to, and try.
